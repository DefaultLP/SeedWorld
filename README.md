# SeedWorld
**3D cubic voxel world engine**

Engine features:

* Tweakable settings for Simplex noise for chunk generator
* Multi-threaded support for chunk generation (each thread processes a chunk independently)
* Simple atmospheric ambient lighting based on 6-sided color map
* Per-vertex lighting for pseudo ambient occlusion
* Day/light cycle for dynamic lighting

This an older project that was developed from late 2014-15, using the XNA framework. Porting to MonoGame is also possible.

The project as-is has optional dependencies for Nuclex Spritefont and NuclearWinter for the UI.
